    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Lahmacun is a common dish in turkey made from <strong>dough, mince meat, onions and tomatoes</strong> 
    Pretty similar to a mince meat pie or pizza. Its main attraction is the way its eaten. Lahmacun is basically a tortilla roll thats crunchy and meaty and salty. 
    Inside people commonly use <strong>lettuce, onions, tomatoes, oregano, lemon juice.</strong></p>
    <p>Standard bread dough is made and stretched to shape roughly 40cm wide. Making it a bit oval will help when doing the roll and its the traditional shape used for long closed ovens. The mince meat mix is made with garlic onions tomatoes and beef with salt, pepper, cumin, hot pepper added for spices. After heating the dough for 10-15 minutes the mix is added on gently spreading and letting the dough envelop some. The juice from tomato and garlic will seep into the dough making it tastier.  </p>
